The day was sunny and warm. The breeze was cooling. The air smells of herbs and jazmine. It was a beautiful day, despite the hardship and misery brought by centuries of Dutch colonialization. A baby boy was born in a small shack. A beautiful young mom was exhausted after the delivery. An old doula was cleaning the baby and wrapped him with a long batik called "selendang".
